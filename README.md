# Python-Auto-Spammer

The project consisted of creating an application that allows the user to automatically type out a file (.txt) into the text medium of their choice, be it livechat or social media messaging/whatsapp etc.

The project was produced to allow me to practice using Python to produce web applications. It also allowed me to experience using PyAutoGUI for the first time.
